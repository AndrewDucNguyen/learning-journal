# Big O Notation
| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Binary Search | O(log n) | O(1) |
| Quick Sort    | O(n log n) | O(log n) |

- Recursive binary search calls itself. It'll return itself
- Number of times a recursive function calls itself is called: **Recursive Depth**
