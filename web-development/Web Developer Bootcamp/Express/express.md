## Libraries vs Frameworks
### Library: 
- When you use a library, you are in charge. You control the flow of the application code, and you decide when to use the library
### Framework:
- With frameworks, the control is inverted. The framework is in charge, and you are merely a participant. The framework tells you where to plug in the code.

## First Express App
* Install Express by doing `npm install express`
