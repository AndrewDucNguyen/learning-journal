# Intro to React

## Things to consider:
* Make sure you're comfortable with vanilla JavaScript

## How React works:
* You make reusable components
* Everything is broken into smaller components, then put together to build a bigger component
* React is more of a eco-system than just a library
* Includes webpack and babel 

## React Folder Structure
### Public Folder:
* Public folder is where the index.html lives and the entry point for the react app
* All content will be rendered in there
### Src Folder:
* Where you write all react code and components
* Style sheets

## Package.json
* React-scripts: depends on webpack, babel
* Dependency lives in here
